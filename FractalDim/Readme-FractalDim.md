# Folder "FractalDim"

* In every text file, each row corresponds to the calculated results of a given predicted protein structure. Each row of data corresponds to the predicted protein structure whose file name is listed in the corresponding text file in the "Index" folder.

* The data listed in the text file is the fractal dimension of the protein (resdiue packing dimension). The fractal dimension is estimated by the box-counting method (i.e., counting how the number of neighboring residues increases as the cutoff distance increases).

* The folder "Model" contains text files corresponding to the 16 model organisms, and the folder "Health" contains the text files corresponding to the 32 organisms related to global health (details listed in SI Table S1).

* Every filename contains information about the reference proteome, the number of proteins, and the species code.
