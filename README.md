# The Statistical Trends of Protein Evolution
Data and code related to the paper "The Statistical Trends of Protein Evolution: A Lesson from AlphaFold Database".

- The data and code will be available before the acceptance of the paper.

- File "Index.zip" includes the file names of the predicted protein structures in the 21 organisms. In other data files, the ordering of data is in accord with the order of protein names in this file.

- Text files "KS-Rg-N250.txt" and "KS-Rg_norm-N_full.txt" include the results of two-sample KS tests for 48 organisms in our database. In "KS-Rg-N250.txt", the results are based on the distribution of R_g for proteins with similar chain lengths (N ~ 250). In text file "KS-Rg_norm-N_full.txt", the results are based on the distribution of normalized R_g (i.e., R_g/N^{1/3}). Further details are listed in the SI Method of the paper.
