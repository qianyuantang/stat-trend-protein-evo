# Folder "Secondary"

* In every text file, each row corresponds to the calculated results of a given predicted protein structure. Each row of data corresponds to the predicted protein structure whose file name is listed in the corresponding text file in the "Index" folder.

* The data listed in each column are:
- Column 1, chain length (N, the number of amino acid residues).
- Column 2, length of loops and irregular elements (estimated with 8-letter DSSP).
- Column 3, length of coils (estimated with 3-letter DSSP).
- Column 4, fraction of loops (based on 8-letter DSSP).
- Column 5, fraction of coils (based on 3-letter DSSP).

* The folder "Model" contains text files corresponding to the 16 model organisms, and the folder "Health" contains the text files corresponding to the 32 organisms related to global health (details listed in SI Table S1).

* Every filename contains information about the reference proteome, the number of proteins, and the species code.
