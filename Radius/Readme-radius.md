# Folder "Radius"

* In every text file, each row corresponds to the calculated results of a given predicted protein structure. Each row of data corresponds to the predicted protein structure whose file name is listed in the corresponding text file in the "Index" folder.

* The data listed in each column are:
- Column 1, chain length (N, the number of amino acid residues).
- Column 2, the radius of gyration (Rg in unit Angstrom).
- Column 3, total solvent-accessible surface area (SASA in unit Angstrom square).
- Column 4, SASA per residue.
- Column 5, gyration tensor (Lx, length of the shortest axis, in unit Angstrom).
- Column 6, gyration tensor (Ly, length of the medium axis, in unit Angstrom).
- Column 7, gyration tensor (Lz, length of the longest axis, in unit Angstrom).

* The folder "Model" contains text files corresponding to the 16 model organisms, and the folder "Health" contains the text files corresponding to the 32 organisms related to global health (details listed in SI Table S1).

* Every filename contains information about the reference proteome, the number of proteins, and the species code.
